Website URL: https://rainzhang.me/

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. As a Computing Science student at 
Simon Fraser University, I created this website to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences to potential 
employers and collaborators. The website serves as a digital resume and a platform to demonstrate my web development abilities.

## Purpose

As a university student actively seeking internship opportunities and professional experience, this portfolio website aims to:

- Present my technical skills and programming knowledge
- Showcase projects I've completed during my academic journey
- Provide information about my educational background
- Offer an easy way for recruiters and potential employers to contact me
- Demonstrate my web development capabilities through the website itself

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Interactive UI**: Features smooth animations, transitions, and interactive elements that enhance user experience.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes based on your preference.
- **Dock Navigation**: macOS-inspired dock for quick access to social media profiles and contact information.
- **Contact Form**: Direct messaging capability for visitors to reach out without leaving the site.
- **Typewriter Effect**: Dynamic text animation in the introduction section.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Enhanced navigation with smooth scrolling to different sections.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content
- **CSS3**: For styling and animations
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements and dynamic content
- **Formspree**: For handling contact form submissions

## Future Improvements

As I continue to grow as a developer and gain more experience, I plan to:

- Add a dedicated projects page with detailed case studies

- Integrate more interactive elements and animations
- Add testimonials from professors and collaborators
- Create a timeline of my academic and professional journey
