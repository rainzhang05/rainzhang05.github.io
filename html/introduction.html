            I am a student currently studying in Simon Fraser University, majoring in SFU Computing Science with
            a Bachelor of Science. I'm a passionate programmer with a strong interest in software development,
            web development, and Artificial Intelligence. As a quick learner, it's always exciting to me when
            I get to learn new things, improve my skills, and build creative projects. I am currently seeking an
            internship opportunity to further develop my skills.
